## **Week 4 - RNN/Tokenizer**
- **Topic**
  - RNN
  - Word Tokenzizer
- **Week 4 Exercise**
  - Train an RNN model using a word tokenizer and monitor only the loss decline.

</br>

## Exercise Description
- main.py train 3 same models by fashon-mnist dataset
- each training method has different optimizers.
- fill blank of SGD, SGD-with-momentum, Adam
- compare accuracy with different optimizers

</br>

## Excepted output

- SGD

- SGD_with_momenum
![week_3_output_momentum](../../images/week_3_output_2.png)
- Adam
![week_3_output_adam](../../images/week_3_output_3.png)

- since we use mlp model, overall accuracy is low
