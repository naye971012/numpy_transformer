## **Week 2 - CNN**
- **Topic**
  - Convolution Layer (2D)
  - MaxPooling (2D)
  - Flatten Layer
- **Week 2 Exercise**
  - Compare NumPy/Torch model accuracy with Linear/CNN models

</br>

## Exercise Description
- main.py train 4 different models by mnist dataset
- fill blank of conv2d, pooling2d layer
- fill blank of week_2_models.py (cnn_model_np part)
- compare accuracy of linear model and cnn model
- compare accuracy of numpy model and torch model

</br>

## Excepted output

- MLP model
